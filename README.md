## How to use it

> **WARNING**: The tool overwrites existing files by default. Be sure to back-up files before use.

1. We recommend that  you back-up and save files that you plan to edit as there is a possibility that changing certain things with save files can cause the game to not be able to read them.

2. Navigate to “%HOMEPATH%\Saved Games\Mojang Studios\Dungeons” in order to access your saves with this program

3. Make necessary edits and then press save
